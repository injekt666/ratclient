### What it is
Here's my super easy RAT source / base. It allows easy packet communication between clients and server using sockets. I threw it together fairly quickly and I'm posting it here for educational purposes. Consider it a kick in the right direction. It's not using any fancy coding standards or anything like that. So don't expect quality work. 

It does not at it's current form have any malicious features, and it's not intended for "hacking" peoples computers. It's just a barebones Remote Administration Tool source code.

By downloading or modifying this source code by any means or channels, you agree that only YOU are to be held responsible for how this is used. You are not allowed to distribute this, any outcome of this, or any modification of it.

This is only meant for educational purposes.
